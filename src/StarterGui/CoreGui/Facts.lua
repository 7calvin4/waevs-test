	"[SHIP FACT]: Ships float due to Archimedes' Principle,\nwhich states that an object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.";
	"[SHIP FACT]: The bulbous bow on a ship reduces drag and improves fuel efficiency by changing the way water flows around the hull.";
	"[SHIP FACT]: Modern supertankers can be over 1,500 feet long — longer than the Empire State Building is tall.";
	"[PHYSICS FACT]: Saltwater is denser than freshwater, which means ships float slightly higher in the ocean than on a lake.";
	"[SHIP FACT]: A ship's center of gravity and center of buoyancy determine its stability — if they're too close or misaligned, the ship can capsize.";
	"[SHIP FACT]: The concept of a 'plimsoll line' marks the safe loading level on a ship depending on the water's density and temperature.";
	"[PHYSICS FACT]: The deeper a ship sits in the water, the greater the pressure exerted on the hull — pressure increases roughly 1 atmosphere every 10 meters.";
	"[SHIP FACT]: The Titanic had a double-bottom hull for added safety — though it wasn’t enough when it struck an iceberg.";
	"[FUN FACT]: Ships use sonar (Sound Navigation And Ranging) to map the ocean floor and detect objects underwater using sound waves.";
	"[SHIP FACT]: Aircraft carriers are equipped with arresting wires that rapidly decelerate landing planes from 150 mph to 0 in just a couple seconds.";
	"[SHIP FACT]: Icebreakers have specially shaped, reinforced hulls that ride up on ice and break it with their weight.";
